# Vanilla JavaScript Calculator Application

_Web Based Calculator Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript_

## Instructions


This calculator contains both on-screen clickable button functionality and keyboard numberpad functionality. When using the keyboard functionality, it is important to note that the "enter" key is used for "equals" functionality. In the current build of this application, the "Clear", "Memory Add", "Memory Clear", and "Memory Recall" functionality can only be accessed through the on-screen clickable buttons.

### Summary

In creating this app, I learned a lot about following the logic through seperate funcitons in order to reach desired functionality. Most of that learning came through debugging. I learned how to track variables as the application ran, and I was able to see and follow along with the path that the logic to from one funciton to the next. Creating this app certainly helped me to develop debugging skills. 

Additionally, I continued to build upon my refactoring skills. This happened when I decided that I wanted to add the keypad funcitonality in additon to the on-screen clickable buttons. Doing so allowed me to practice refactoring by creating parameters for shared functions and passing arguments into those functions when called in order to get the desired functionality. It was fun to learn those skills, and I look forward to using those skills in future applications and projects. 

Update: In refactoring, I moved HTML element references together as well as the event listeners for better readability. Additionally, I refactored longer functions out into smaller helper functions to help with debugging in the future. Lastly, I refactored callback functions to reflect my better understanding of ES6 arrow functions to help the code become more concise and readable, as well as added ternary operators in place of longer if statements for the same reason.
